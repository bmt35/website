	echo "<p>My junior year was my toughest year at Pitt. I began to take more complicated computer science classes
                and had to balance the heavy work load of all of them.<br>I decided to take linear algebra to complete my related area
                of study in math and it was definitely one of the more interesting math classes I have taken. Algorithm implementation was one of 
                the hardest CS classes I have taken, but it was also the class where I learned the most.<br>
