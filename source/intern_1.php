	echo "<p>I interned in the Governance and Controls Departments of UPMC ISD, where my work focused more on the process side of software.<br>
                I created trends and performed data analysis for the newly created Incident Management Group.<br>
                I assisted the technical team with deploying Cherwell, an IT service management software, by creating virtual stockrooms for UPMC assets.<br>
                I developed an Access database for UPMC applications and servers using SQL and VBA. The purpose of this database was to allow users to see which servers an application resides on and to see which applications are downstream from other applications.
