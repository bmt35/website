                and the Fall as I took classes. Surprisingly, I enjoyed taking classes and working as opposed to just working. Since I <br>
                finished most of my general education requirements in previous years, I could take just computer science classes from now on. <br>
                I enjoyed having many different projects going on at once and being able to see them to completion.
