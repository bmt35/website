	echo "<p>I interned in the Governance and Controls Department again, this time focusing more on business intelligence work.<br>I created custom Power BI reports and dashboards for management using Power BI, SQL, and DAX.
              The creation of these dashboards required meeting with users and translating their requests into technical requirements and then meeting with them many more times to get feedback on what I had created for them.<br> Along with getting feedback from users, I also had to transform datasets so that they could be visualized in Power BI. This ranged from cleaning the data and creating aggregate functions to creating relationships between data sets.</p>";
